HOW TO HAVE AN UP-TO-DATE VERSION OF THIS PROJECT ON YOUR COMPUTER:

-Download/set-up Git via this link:
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

-Make a folder where you want to store the project
-Navigate to that folder via the terminal 
-Enter in terminal "git clone https://github.com/vassarirrl/IRRL-website.git"

You should now have an up-to-date clone of the website. For further info consult:
http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository

I will eventually explain more fully how to edit/make sure you didn't overwrite other people's files when you commit your changes, but you can safely fiddle with the clone without causing any problems.
